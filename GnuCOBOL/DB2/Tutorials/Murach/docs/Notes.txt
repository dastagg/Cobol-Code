Because there are tables used in this book that
have the same names as the Sample DB, I decided 
to create a new Datbase and call it Murach.

IBM Db2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows v11.1.

Created a new Datbase.
    Opened the DB2 Admin window.
    Typed "db2" at the prompt.
    This got me "into the system".
    at the db2> prompt, typed "CREATE DATABASE murach" and hit Enter.
    waited a bit of time and it came back with "successfully created database"

Opened PyCharm.
    Created new database connection for DB2 LUW:
    Type4
    localhost, 50000
    MURACH as the database.
    Connected.

Ran the "create table" sql for Customers.

In PyCharm, had to go to the Schema tab, select "dastagg" as a viewable
Schema, then I was able to see the table.
