This is code I have created or copied and modified as I progress learning COBOL.

This repository will replace both Cobol-Projects and DB2-COBOL-et-al for all COBOL code.

There are three main areas:

    GnuCOBOL: These are programs that were written to use the GnuCOBOL compiler.

    Mainframe: These are programs that were written to use the IBM Enterprise COBOL compiler.

    Zowe: These are scripts that use the Zowe CLI to do stuff on the Mainframe.


### Special Note:
There are 3 areas which might be of interest to people just starting out with COBOL.

DB2, Indexed(VSAM) and Internal-Sort.
Within each area, there is a collection of basic
programs for each type of processing.

**However**, ALL programs in these areas are the same versions of each other BUT have been modified to run both using GnuCOBOL and the Mainframe.

[GnuCOBOL](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnucobol/): per the website: GnuCOBOL (formerly OpenCOBOL) is a free, modern COBOL compiler. 

Mainframe: 
I have access to 2 Mainframes thanks to IBM providing them, for free, as part of an effort to introduce
Mainframe COBOL programming to students.

The two classes I participated and earned badges for were:

[Learn to code in COBOL using VSCode](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/projects/coboltrainingcourse) program and

[Enterprise COBOL for Business Application Programming](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/ibmz-and-linuxone/viewdocument/enterprise-cobol-for-business-appli?CommunityKey=b0dae4a8-74eb-44ac-86c7-90f3cd32909a&tab=librarydocuments) class.

[Zowe](https://www.zowe.org/): From their site: "Zowe is an open source project created to host technologies that benefit the Z platform". 
It's an API that allows you to interface with the Mainframe in a couple of different ways. It's kinda neat! 

There will be quite a few programs that are the same but with slight modifications for the different environments they will run in.

See README2 for a description of the naming convention I am using for the various tutorals.

See README3 for the list of the tutorials I am working through and how far I have gotten.

See README4 for the list of Enterprise COBOL for Business Application Programming assignments and how far I have gotten.

*Note*: You may notice a difference betweeen this repository and Cobol-Projects.

I have decided to not write programs for the MVS 3.8 environment. While that was interesting, if I wanted to go back to 1974 (the date of the COBOL compiler on the MVS 3.8(TK4-) system), I could probably find more interesting things to study from that time period.

And I decided to restructure the repo in a different way.
