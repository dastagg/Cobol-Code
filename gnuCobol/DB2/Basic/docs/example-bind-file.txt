This is an example prep and bind file for 
the pre-compile process for GnuCOBOL/DB2.


connect to <DB> user <username> using <password>;
prep ..\cbl\DBCBEX01.sqb bindfile target ANSI_COBOL output ..\tcbl\DBCBEX01.cbl;
bind ..\cbl\DBCBEX01.bnd;
connect reset;


To Use:
You would need to update <DB>, <username> and <password>
to the correct parameters.

If your database was "SAMPLE", your username was "mary" and your
password was "hadalittlelamb" the connect line would look like:
(Note: the password IS case-sensitive!)

connect to SAMPLE user mary using hadalittlelamb;

You would also change all the references to the program you are compiling.
