These are the sql scripts to create the BOOK table.

This is the table used in the GnuCOBOL/DB2 examples
created by [László Erdős](https://sourceforge.net/p/gnucobol/contrib/HEAD/tree/trunk/samples/DBsample/DB2/).

Note: to use them, you will have to change the parameters for your installation of DB2.

AND!!! I have changed the original version.
"TITLE" is now a reserved word so I changed all references to it to "BTITLE" to avoid the errors.
